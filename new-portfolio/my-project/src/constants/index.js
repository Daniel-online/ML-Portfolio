export const HERO_CONTENT = `I enjoy building SAPs and APIs for the web üåê, creating desktop apps and cli tools as well. Sometimes i venture into frontend and sometimes into backend. That said, my professional specialization is on Node.js üü© and i aim to become a core contributor to the project. 
My journey of web development has brought me to two conclusions: 
we need more security on the web and simpler production workflows
These two statements may often conflict, but creating the balance within both is what made me deep dive into the node ecossystem to make it better than we thought it could be.
